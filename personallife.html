            In November 2020, Sunak was reported by The Guardian to have not declared a significant amount of his wife and family's financial interests on the register of ministers' interests, including a combined £1.7 billion shareholding in the Indian company Infosys.Ministers are required to declare interests that are "relevant" to their responsibilities and "which might be thought to give rise to a conflict" with their public duties.The independent adviser on ministers' interests investigated and concluded that Sunak had not broken any rules.<br>

            In early 2022, newspapers reported that Sunak's wife Akshata Murty had non-domiciled status, meaning she did not have to pay tax on income earned abroad while living in the UK.The status cost approximately £30,000 to secure, and allowed her to avoid paying an estimated £20 million in UK taxes.Following media controversy, Murty stated on 8 April that she would pay UK taxes on her global income, adding in a statement that she did not want the issue "to be a distraction for my husband".<br>
             A Whitehall inquiry was launched into who had leaked the details of her tax status.Labour party leader Keir Starmer accused Sunak of "taxation 'hypocrisy' on the grounds that he was putting up taxes for ordinary Britons while his family had been reducing its own tax liabilities".<br>

            Reporting around this time also revealed that Sunak had continued to hold United States' permanent resident (green card) status he had acquired in the 2000s until 2021, including for 18 months after he was Britain's treasury Chancellor, which required his filing annual US tax returns.An investigation into both his wife's tax status and his residency status found that Sunak had not broken ministerial rules.
