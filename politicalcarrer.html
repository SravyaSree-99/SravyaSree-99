The seat was previously held by William Hague, a former leader of the party, Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State.The seat is one of the safest Conservative seats in the United Kingdom and has been held by the party for over 100 years. In the same year Sunak was head of the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Research Unit of centre-right think tank Policy Exchange, for which he co-wrote a report on BME communities in the UK.He was elected as MP for the constituency at the 2015 general election with a majority of 19,550 (36.2%).[36] During the 2015–2017 parliament he was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee.

    Sunak supported Brexit (the UK leaving the European Union) at the June 2016 EU membership referendum. That year, he wrote a report for the Centre for Policy Studies (a Thatcherite think tank) supporting the establishment of free ports after Brexit, and the following year wrote a report advocating the creation of a retail bond market for small and medium-sized enterprises.
        
    Sunak was re-elected at the 2017 general election, with an increased majority of 23,108 (40.5%).He served as parliamentary under-secretary of state for local government between January 2018 and July 2019.Sunak voted for then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement on all three occasions, and voted against a second referendum on any withdrawal agreement.

            <h1>Chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–2022)</h1>
            <p>n the weeks before Sunak's appointment as chancellor of the Exchequer, press briefings suggested that a new economic ministry led by Sunak might be established to reduce the power and influence of Chancellor Javid at the Treasury. Sunak was considered a Johnson loyalist, favoured by Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, and was seen as the "rising star" that had ably represented Johnson during the 2019 election debates.<br>

            In February 2020, The Guardian reported that Javid would remain in his role as Chancellor and that Sunak would remain chief secretary to the Treasury, so that Cummings could "keep an eye" on Javid </p>
