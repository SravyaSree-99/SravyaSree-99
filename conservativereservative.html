        July – September 2022
On 8 July 2022, Sunak stood in the Conservative party leadership election to replace Johnson.Sunak launched his campaign in a video posted to social media, writing that he would "restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country".He said his values were "patriotism, fairness, hard work".Sunak pledged to "crack down on gender neutral language".The domain readyforrishi.com was first registered with GoDaddy on 23 December 2021, while ready4rishi.com was registered on 6 July 2022, two days after Sunak resigned as chancellor.The former domain acts as a redirect to the latter. Conservative politicians who had supported Johnson criticised Sunak as "leading the charge in bringing down the prime minister" with Johnson ally Jacob Rees-Mogg calling him a "high tax chancellor".<br>

Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emerged as the final two candidates in the contest on 20 July to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote; he had received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes with Sunak receiving 137 to Truss's 113 in the final round.In the membership vote, Truss received 57.4% of the vote, making her the new leader over Sunak.<br>

Sunak's pledges during the campaign included tax cuts only when inflation was under control, scrapping of the 5% VAT rate on household energy for one year, introducing a temporary £10 fine for patients who fail to attend GP appointments, capping of refugee numbers, and a tightening of the definition of asylum.<br>

During the campaign, a clip from the 2001 BBC documentary Middle Classes: Their Rise and Sprawl,emerged in July 2022 in which he remarked, "I have friends who are aristocrats, I have friends who are upper class, I have friends who are, you know, working class but... well not working class".Sunak commented on the clip that "We all say silly things when we are younger".A video of Sunak speaking to an audience in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, emerged in August 2022 in which he said he changed funding formulas which "shoved" money into "deprived urban areas", "to make sure that areas like this are getting the funding they deserve." Sunak responded that he wanted to "level up everywhere" and not just help "very large urban cities".Following Liz Truss's victory in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership election, Sunak returned to the backbenches.<br>
